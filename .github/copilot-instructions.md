# üè∫ Pyramid Scheme ‚Äî AI Coding Agent Instructions

## Big Picture Architecture
- **React + TypeScript + Vite**: The game is a modular React app with strong type safety and fast dev workflow.
- **Game Structure**: Core gameplay is split into Pyramid Expeditions (progressive puzzles) and Treasure Tombs (unlockable vaults). Each journey and tomb is defined in `src/data/journeys.ts` and `src/data/tableaus.ts`.
- **Puzzle System**: Puzzles are generated deterministically using seeded random logic (`src/game/random.ts`). Tableaux (puzzle blueprints) drive level content and difficulty scaling.
- **State Management**: Game state (progress, inventory, logs) is managed in `src/app/state/` using custom hooks and context.
- **Internationalization**: All UI and game text is localized via `src/i18n/` and `public/locales/`.
- **UI Components**: Reusable, themed components live in `src/ui/`. Storybook is used for documentation and visual testing.

## Developer Workflows
- **Dev Server**: `yarn dev` (http://localhost:9164)
- **Testing**: `yarn test` (Jest)
- **Type Checking**: `yarn check-types`
- **Linting**: `yarn lint` (Tailwind class order enforced)
- **Build**: `yarn build`
- **Storybook**: `yarn storybook`
- **Translations**: Edit `public/locales/en/common.json` and `public/locales/nl/common.json` for i18n.

## Project-Specific Conventions
- **Tailwind CSS**: Class order is enforced by linter; always use canonical order in JSX.
- **Puzzle Generation**: Always use deterministic random functions for puzzle and reward logic (`mulberry32`, `generateNewSeed`).
- **Component Structure**: UI components are highly themed (Egyptian style) and documented in Storybook. Use props for customization.
- **Game Data**: All journeys, tableaus, and difficulty levels are defined in `src/data/`. Never hardcode game logic in UI files.
- **State Hooks**: Use hooks from `src/app/state/` for all game progress, inventory, and log operations.
- **Internationalization**: Use `useTranslation` from `react-i18next` for all user-facing text.

## Integration Points & Patterns
- **Expedition Flow**: `TombExpedition` and `PyramidExpedition` orchestrate puzzle progression, completion, and reward logic.
- **Reward Logic**: Use `generateRewardCalculation` and inventory hooks for loot awarding.
- **Overlay/Backdrop**: Use themed backdrop components (e.g., `TombBackdrop`) for puzzle screens.
- **Storybook**: All new UI components should have a Storybook story in `src/ui/`.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` handles deploys; version checks are conditional on event type.

## Key Files & Directories
- `src/app/` ‚Äî Main app, pages, state, expedition logic
- `src/data/` ‚Äî Game data, journeys, tableaus, difficulty
- `src/game/` ‚Äî Core game logic, randomization, reward calculation
- `src/ui/` ‚Äî Themed UI components, Storybook stories
- `src/i18n/` & `public/locales/` ‚Äî Internationalization
- `.github/workflows/` ‚Äî CI/CD workflows

## Example Patterns


## Microstory Titles & Localization Workflow (2025 Update)

**Microstory Titles**: For all tableau microstories (especially starter), titles must be short, narrative, and reference the story/description more than the symbols. Titles should fit the ancient Egyptian setting and be evocative of the description. Use the run/level key format (e.g., `run1_level1`).

**Localization Sync**: Always update both English and Dutch translation files in sync, ensuring keys and values match in both languages. Titles and descriptions must be narrative-driven and in sync across languages.

**Microstory Title Update Workflow**:
1. When updating or adding tableau microstories, generate titles that are short, narrative, and reference the story/description (not just the symbols).
2. Ensure all titles fit the ancient Egyptian theme and are evocative of the description.
3. Use the run/level key format for all tableau keys.
4. Update both `en/tableaus.json` and `nl/tableaus.json` in sync, keeping order and meaning consistent.
5. Validate that all keys and values are in sync and narrative-driven after any manual or automated edit.
If any conventions or workflows are unclear, please ask for clarification or examples from the codebase. Iterate and update this file as new patterns emerge.
