## 🎲 Game Mathematics

The puzzle system uses carefully balanced mathematical formulas:

- **Linear Progression**: Difficulty scales predictably across levels
- **Symbol Distribution**: Each difficulty tier introduces new symbol sets
- **Formula Complexity**: Operations range from simple addition to complex multi-step calculations
- **Deterministic Generation**: Same seed always produces same puzzles for consistency

## 🎮 Gameplay Tips

1. **Start Small**: Begin with Starter pyramids to learn the symbol system
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Look for recurring symbol combinations
3. **Progressive Learning**: Each difficulty builds on previous knowledge
4. **Map Collection**: Focus on completing expeditions to unlock treasure tombs
5. **Time Management**: Different times of day offer varied experiences
