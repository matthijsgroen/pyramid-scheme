# Camp release review list

The designer's morning list for the unattended camp-release queue. Newest phase last within each section.

## Decisions

- A new `camp` mod owns camp items, structure parts, the camp's saved state and the camp screens' content (queue default).
- Waterskin belongs to the trap mod: heals one heart at once if one is missing, otherwise nothing, and is used up either way (queue default).
- Healing happens at the camp fire: hearts refill to full on every coming home (queue default).
- Coming home fires on every return to base: a journey's end and leaving mid-journey (queue default).
- Pack-mule and the supplies detector: pack-mule becomes "a waterskin heals two hearts", the supplies detector is removed and its three treasures carry no perk (queue default).
- Animal prices are authored defaults that satisfy the per-gate guard with a margin; animals are bought from Fez in tomb shops only (queue default).
- Where things live once the pager is gone: settings behind a gear in the camp HUD, story log as a Verzameling tab, mosaic window opens the mosaic screen, dev tools move to settings (queue default).
- Phase 1 — 60 waterskins, not 150, the rest of the freed expert-and-up puzzle slots wait for phase 3's camp loot. Alternative: 150, keeping today's puzzle-loot share.
- Phase 1 — Waterskins spread evenly by tier (20 each over expert, master, wizard), round-robin over sites. Alternative: proportional to each tier's puzzle slots.
- Phase 1 — The shop's money budget keeps its size via an authored allowance of 1070 coins until phase 5. Alternative: let the budget fall to the rare stock.
- Phase 1 — Shop stock slots the consumables filled stay empty and the "Supplies" section goes, until phase 4 sells animals. Alternative: fill them with rares or sellables.
- Phase 1 — Pack-mule keeps its perk id `pack-mule`; only meaning and label change. Alternative: rename the id.
- Phase 1 — The supplies detector's three treasures (`expert_b_1`, `master_b_1`, `wizard_b_1`) carry perk `none`. Alternative: give them a new perk.
- Phase 1 — Waterskin is reward type `waterskin`, icon 💧, heals one heart, plain reward popup. Alternative: a popup that says whether it healed.
- Phase 1 — Disarming a trap goes with the trap tool, no replacement. Alternative: keep a disarm action some other way.
- Phase 1 — Coming home fires on the two exits to base (journey complete, close), not on chaining into the next journey or an app reload on the base. Alternative: fire on those too.
- Phase 1 — Fez's `shopArrival2` loses "everyday supplies" (en + nl). Alternative: keep the line and the supplies wording.
- Phase 1 fingerprints — starter moved (`8689d49a0de31c21`): one more coin on a puzzle (71 → 72 drops with loot, 152 → 155 coins); the coin round-robin's cut-off shifts when the expert-and-up puzzle pools change.
- Phase 1 fingerprints — junior moved (`1d5597b49315f636`): its tomb shop's 4 supply stock slots fall empty, and one more coin on a puzzle (201 → 202 coins), the same round-robin shift.
- Phase 1 fingerprints — expert moved (`9cd2d41a4173e69a`): 56 supply puzzle slots become 20 waterskins and 36 empty puzzles; 9 shop stock slots empty; coins 187 → 185.
- Phase 1 fingerprints — master moved (`b6f13390418f0f13`): 56 supply puzzle slots become 20 waterskins and 36 empty puzzles; 9 shop stock slots empty; coins 197 → 196.
- Phase 1 fingerprints — wizard moved (`f2faabe2e557a758`): 38 supply puzzle slots become 20 waterskins and 18 empty puzzles; 13 shop stock slots empty; coins 345 → 344.

## Drafts

- Phase 1 — Fez's `shopArrival2`, now without supplies. en: "Rare finds cost the most, but I'll pay you for any trinkets you're carrying." nl: "Zeldzame vondsten kosten het meest, maar ik betaal je voor snuisterijen die je meedraagt."
- Phase 1 — `chest.waterskinDescription`. en: "Cool water. You drink it on the spot and feel your wounds ease." nl: "Koel water. Je drinkt hem meteen leeg en voelt je wonden minder pijn doen."
